# iTunesSearchApp

This project was created by Zaccary Gioffre on July 19, 2016. A few issues I would deal if I had more time would include: 
using SwiftyJSON, AlamoFire or AWS to run the project asynchronously. I used Synchronous calls for times sake and to only utilize the swift language. Furthermore, I was not sure of what is, or is not excluded text to search by; meaning could the user simply search for "the" or use non Alpha-numeric text. If I had more time I would clarify what is or is not searchable and keep a dictionary of these strings, and make sure the user does not search for those excluding characters alone. I also did not deal with excessively long strings 
in the table for times sake.
